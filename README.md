Hello coder, I am Ajith C Ravi.
Thanks for taking time to go through my code.
For your information, this folder consists of .html and .js files of weather app.
So this is what it does, it has some pre-set weather values of some pre-set cities
    and shows them on demand.
This is just a sample project so the weather values are assumed.

This is a weather app that gives temperature and weather condition of the city selected.
